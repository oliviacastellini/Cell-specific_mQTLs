## Background

Research question: 

Aims: 

- Compare mQTL associations across contexts
- Can we use predicted cell counts in blood to faithfully reproduce mQTLs in cell-sorted data



## Analysis

### Normalisation methylation data

#### Sorted cell types

To normalise use meffil

```
Rscript scripts/something.r
```

#### Bulk tissue

Already normalised, details -

### Generate matrixeqtl inputs

Use steps 1-3 in GoDMC pipeline. Separate clone for each cell type.

### Perform mQTL analysis 

Use specific scripts in /resources/ folder for each cloned pipeline repository

### Comparison
